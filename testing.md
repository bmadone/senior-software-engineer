# Testing

* What is automated testing, and what is the difference from manual testing?
* What is unit-test?
* What is TDD?
* What is the advantage of TDD? Why write tests first and then code?
* What are regression bugs and how do automated tests help solve them?
* Why do side effects impair code testability?
* What is mock and when should they be used?
* What is a spy and when should they be used?
* Is it worth testing private class methods? Why?
* Why group separate tests inside unit tests?
* How long should an ideal work cycle last: _ writing a test -> changing functionality -> refactoring_?
* What libraries are there for creating tests and running them (and how do they differ from each other)?
* How do tests help newcomers enter the project?
* How do tests help in documenting a project?
* How do tests speed up getting feedback from the work done and why is this feedback important?
* What steps in manual testing help avoid unit tests?
* Why make tests run fast?
* How to ensure that test errors are as obvious as possible?
* Do I need to automatically test the tests themselves?
* What are the boundary conditions? Why test them?
* What is heisenbug? What are the ways to debug them?
* What is fixture?
* What is code coverage with tests? What tools are there for analyzing it?
* How are unit tests different from integration tests? Why is integration harder to write and maintain?
* Why pay attention to patterns when tests fail? How can analysis of which particular test combination fall off help?
* How do tests help in designing? Why is module testability an excellent indicator of "code cleanliness"?
* How do tests help with refactoring?
* What are the advantages of the rule of one concept per unit test?
* What are the advantages of tests isolated from each other?
* How to find a balance between the number of tests and code coverage? What problems can be caused by an excessive number of unit tests?
* What is a test pyramid? What role do tests play there? What role does static code analysis play there?
* Are types a complete replacement for unit tests? Why?
* What are end-to-end tests? What is the difference from integration?
* When do tests really slow down development, and when do they speed up?
* Are tests a full part of the system and code base?
* Why is testing becoming less convenient if you test not only public but also private methods?
* What are Test Double and Fake? What is the difference from Mock and Stub?
* What is the difference between testing with behavior verification and state verification?
* Why does the application of Mocks provoke behavior verification?
* What are Solitary and Sociable tests? What are the benefits of solitary tests? Are there any benefits to Sociable tests?
* Why does Mocks simplify outside-in design?
* Why strive to ensure that tests can be run as conveniently as possible and with just one team?
* Is it worth writing "training" integration tests that are run only manually and only for testing an external API (for example, the Web API Github)?
